# Rental Management System

## Project Overview
The project involves developing a comprehensive Rental Management System designed to enhance and streamline rental operations for various user roles. Building upon the previous A1, the system introduces five distinct user types: Visitor, Tenant, Host, Owner, and Manager, each with specific functionalities tailored to their responsibilities. 

Visitors can browse and filter available rental properties without the need to log in. 

Tenants have the ability to manage their personal information, view rental agreements, and access payment details. 

Hosts can oversee their properties, modify rental agreements, track unpaid payments, and access property-specific statistics. 

Owners are empowered to add new properties, including uploading images, ensuring efficient storage and display within the system. 

Managers possess full control, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all entities and access to comprehensive system-wide statistics.
